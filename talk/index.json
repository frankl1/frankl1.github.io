It is used in a diverse range of domains such as meteorology, medicine and physics. In the last decade, many algorithms have been built to perform this task with very appreciable accuracy. However, applications where time series have uncertainty has been under-explored. Using uncertainty propagation techniques, we propose a new uncertain dissimilarity measure based on Euclidean distance. We then propose the uncertain shapelet transform algorithm for the classification of uncertain time series. The large experiments we conducted on state of the art datasets show the effectiveness of our contribution. The source code of our contribution and the datasets we used are all available on a public repository.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Uncertain Time Series Classification with Shapelet Transform","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michael Franklin MBOUOPDA","Engelbert MEPHU NGUIFO"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

Many NER systems have been developed, but the annotated data needed for learning is not available for low-resource languages, such as Cameroonian languages. In this paper we exploit the low frequency of named entities in text to define a new suitable word representation for named entity recognition. We build the first Ewondo (a Bantu language of Cameroon) named entities recognizer by projecting named entity tags from English using our word representation. In terms of Recall, Precision and F-score, the obtained results show the effectiveness of the proposed word representation.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"A Word Representation to Improve Named Entity Recognition in Low-resource Languages","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michael Franklin MBOUOPDA","Engelbert MEPHU NGUIFO"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.
