C'est ainsi que nous nous intéressons au challenge de la conférence EGC 2022, qui consiste à prédire l'évolution du niveau des nappes sur une durée de trois mois dans le futur. Dans cet article, nous proposons d'utiliser trois types de réseau de neurones (convolutif, récurrent et résiduel) qui collaborent afin de prédire la charge hydraulique toutes les 24 heures allant du 15 octobre 2021 au 15 janvier 2022.

This approach is especially characterized by its interpretable property and its fast prediction time. However, given a dataset of n time series of length at most m, learning shapelets requires a computation time of O(n 2 m 4) which is too high for practical datasets. In this paper, we exploit the fact that shapelets are shared by the members of the same class to propose the SAST (Scalable and Accurate Subsequence Transform) algorithm which is interpretable, accurate and more faster than the actual state of the art shapelet algorithm. The experiments we conducted on the UCR archive datasets shown that SAST is more accurate than the state of the art Shapelet Transform algorithm on many datasets, while being significantly more scalable.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Scalable and Accurate Subsequence Transform for Time Series Classification","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michael Franklin MBOUOPDA"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1622541076,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1622541076,"objectID":"cbde83860c22f155fb412a767fdde29e","permalink":"https://frankl1.github.io/project/monpoulailler/","publishdate":"2021-06-01T11:51:16+02:00","relpermalink":"/project/monpoulailler/","section":"project","summary":"An android application that allows chicken farmers to manage their business and improve their profitability with the utmost simplicity.
